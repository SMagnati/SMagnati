- ⚡ "Have faith in progress, which is always right, even when it's wrong. Because it is movement, life, struggle, hope. And beware of putting progress on trial, even if it should be an impostor, a traitor, an assassin, a thief, or an arsonist. Progress is always right." - Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, from "Teoria e Invenzione Futurista" (Futurist Theory and Invention), Mondadori, 1968
